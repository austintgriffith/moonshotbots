so heres whats up

we want to launch a collectible pfp project with proceeds and trading fees targeted towards  funding public goods.

basically it would be a project that would generate 1000 PFPs, and we would tokenize them + sell them to our network of developer/designer friends.  the sales and resale values would go to public goods

the idea is to make it SOLARPUNK themed; Solarpunk is an art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability problems such as climate change and pollution
